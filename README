GNU Autotools are required for building the project.

To initially configure the working dir, run:
$autoreconf --install

If successfull, this will generate the ./configure script.
To generate the Makefile, run:
$./configure

Autotools by default enable several options for the ./configure script.
To see the list of all available options (depends on the local environment), run:
$./configure -h

There are three other options configured in the ./configure.ac file:
  --enable-splint         Enable splint static analizer.
  --enable-valgrind       Use valgrind when running unit tests.
  --enable-coverage       Enable tests coverage statistics.

E.g. To enable the static analizer - splint, generate the Makefile by running:
$./configure --enable-splint

There would be many Makefile targets defined by autotools,
but only few of them are important for sartup.

To build the project, run:
$ make

This will build the project and generate the ./libclumsy.la library.
To run the static analizer (only if enabled), run:
$ make analyze

This will analyze all the source files placed under ./src 
and its subdirectories, except unit tests placed under ./src/tests.
To run the unit tests, run:
$make check

This will build the unit tests, and link them against the ./libclumsy.la.
If valgrind was enabled, runtime memory profiling would be done.

To COMPLETLY clean the project, including the files generated by autotools, run:
$make autoclean
